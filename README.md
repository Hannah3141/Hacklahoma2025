# More Books, Less Tech
Burdened with demanding schedules, we college students have little time to waste scouring the internet for books we're already struggling to fit into our reading lists. As such, we decided to create a website to find our books for us! Our project, _More Books, Less Tech_, allows users to add the books they want to read to a list that immediately searches the Tulsa City-County Library's catalogue. Users can find out if the physical book they desire is available at a nearby location, and if so, where to go to check it out. Furthermore, users can sort their reading lists, prioritizing the books available so that they minimize **need** time and maximize **read** time!
